<h2>About the game</h2>
<p>
<a href="http://www.factorio.com">Factorio</a> is a game in which you build and maintain factories.
</p>

<p>
You will be mining resources, researching technologies, building infrastructure, automating production and fighting enemies. Use your imagination to design your factory, combine simple elements into ingenious structures, apply management skills to keep it working and finally protect it from the creatures who don't really like you.
</p>

<p>
The game is very stable and optimized for building massive factories. You can create your own maps, write mods in Lua or play with friends via Multiplayer.
</p>

<h2>Purpose of the guide</h2>

<p>
Factorio is a game with a steep learning curve. There are so many things to do in the game, that new players can often get overwhelmed. At the moment there are a few main places that players can go to find information about the game:
<ul style="color:white;">
  <li>
The ingame tutorial: this series of missions leads the player through basics of the game. However it hasn't been updated in a while and also it doesn't touch any of the more advanced topics. Basically leaving the player to explore the game on his own.
 </li>

  <li>
  The <a href="http://wiki.factorio.com">Factorio wiki</a>: at the moment this is a completely community driven source of information. Unfortunately there is not a clear direction and product owner for it. The result is that a lot of information is missing, inconsistent or old.
 </li>

  <li>
Youtube videos: they are often enjoyable to watch. But the sheer amount of them might scare off most of the new people.
 </li>

 <li>
 There are other places like <a href="http://forums.factorio.com">Factorio forums</a>, dedicated <a href="http://reddit.com/r/factorio">subreddit</a> or other small comunities.
 </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
With the above in mind, the purpose of this guide is to bring Factorio closer to people new to the game. Hence the content is aimed at Beginner and Intermediate players.
</p>

<p>
This is not a reference or step-by-step manual. An overview of all the main concepts in the game is given with basic explanations, accompanied by screenshots from the game, useful tips and sometimes links to other resources.
</p>

<p>
We are commited to improving the in-game tutorial and possibly also adding mini missions to help understand game concepts by playing with them. But before that happens this guide is probably the best resource to consult when starting with the game.
